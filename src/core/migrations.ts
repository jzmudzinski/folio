// Schema migration framework.
//
// db.ts uses a TWO-PHASE bootstrap (since v0.9.1):
//   PHASE1_SCHEMA      meta table only — always safe, no column refs anywhere
//   runMigrations()    ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN for every column added since the
//                      db was last opened. Greenfield installs skip this loop
//                      because schema_version is seeded at HEAD before it runs.
//   PHASE2_SCHEMA      tables + indexes — at this point every column referenced
//                      by an index has either always existed or just been added
//                      by a migration. CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS is safe.
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING RULE for any schema change that touches existing tables:
//
//   1. New columns go ONLY via a migration's up() — never inline in
//      PHASE1_SCHEMA or PHASE2_SCHEMA's CREATE TABLE block alone, because
//      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is a no-op on existing tables (the new
//      column would never reach pre-existing dbs).
//
//      Caveat: also list the column in PHASE2_SCHEMA's CREATE TABLE so
//      greenfield installs get the head shape directly. The migration
//      handles upgrades; the CREATE TABLE handles fresh installs. Both
//      converge to the same schema.
//
//   2. New indexes that reference the new column go in PHASE2_SCHEMA, not
//      in the migration's up(). PHASE2 runs AFTER migrations on existing
//      dbs, so the column is guaranteed to exist by then. CREATE INDEX
//      IF NOT EXISTS in PHASE2 is the canonical place for all indexes.
//
//      Why not put the index in the migration too? Because greenfield
//      installs skip migrations entirely — the index would never get
//      created. Putting it in PHASE2 covers both paths.
//
//   3. Never edit a shipped migration's up(). Append a new entry to
//      MIGRATIONS instead. A user who's at schema_version='3' will not
//      re-run migration 1→2; if you "fix" 1→2 after shipping, users
//      on >=3 never see the fix.
//
// The v0.9.0 → v0.9.1 hotfix is the cautionary tale: notes_by_live was
// declared in BASE_SCHEMA next to the CREATE TABLE that should have added
// `live`. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS was a no-op on existing tables, so
// the column wasn't there, and CREATE INDEX hit "no such column: live"
// on every upgrade.
//
// Pattern: each migration has {from, to, up}. Runner reads
// meta.schema_version, applies any migration whose `from` matches the
// current version, bumps to `to`, repeats until no migration applies.
// Migrations must be idempotent (use PRAGMA table_info to check before
// ALTER) so a partial run + re-run still converges.
